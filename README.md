# Decentralized Energy Attribute Certificate System

## Overview

The Decentralized Energy Attribute Certificate System revolutionizes how renewable energy is verified, tracked, and traded. This blockchain-based platform creates an immutable record of green energy production, enabling transparent certification and seamless trading of renewable energy credits.

## Core Components

### Generator Verification Contract
Validates renewable energy sources through digital attestation of equipment specifications, installation verification, and ongoing proof of renewable operation. Ensures only legitimate renewable generators can participate in the certificate ecosystem.

### Production Monitoring Contract
Tracks actual green energy generation in real-time using IoT device integration, cryptographically secured meter readings, and tamper-proof data collection. Provides the foundation for accurate certificate issuance based on verified production.

### Certificate Issuance Contract
Creates tradable digital proof of renewable energy generation as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent specific quantities of green energy. Each certificate contains metadata about the energy source, location, time of generation, and carbon impact.

### Compliance Tracking Contract
Monitors adherence to renewable energy mandates and voluntary commitments through automated reporting, regulatory integration, and auditable proof of compliance. Simplifies renewable portfolio standard (RPS) verification.

## Getting Started

1. **Generator Registration**: Complete verification of renewable energy equipment
2. **Monitoring Setup**: Connect production monitoring devices to the platform
3. **Certificate Generation**: Automatically receive certificates based on verified production
4. **Trading**: Sell certificates on the integrated marketplace
5. **Compliance**: Submit certificates for regulatory compliance or voluntary programs

## Technical Architecture

The system utilizes blockchain technology to ensure immutability and transparency. Smart contracts automate certificate issuance based on verified production data, while the trading platform enables frictionless exchange of energy attributes.
